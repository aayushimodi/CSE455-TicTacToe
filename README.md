#### By: Aayushi Modi, Riya Baheti, Sashu Shankar

Welcome to  our CSE 455 Final Project: **Webcam Based Two Player Tic Tac Toe**. This game tracks an image of a X or O using the webcame on a standard laptop to control and play a two-player game of tic tac toe. This mimics Xbox Kinect in a more convenient and portable format.

### Requirements to Run Code & Notes
In order to play this game, you must be using a computer with a webcam (either inbuilt or one that is plugged in should work).
In order to run the code, you may need to import some libaries (Python will error and indicate which libraries you are missing that are required for the project). Also note that for Windows users, you cannot run the program through WSL, you must run it on a Windows terminal so that the program can access the computer's webcam.

### To Play
Download the tictactoe.py and run it in your terminal with the command `python tictactoe.py`. Press `r` or `b` after hovering over the box you would like to select to place an `X` or `O` there respectively.
